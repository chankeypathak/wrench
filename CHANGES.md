Being a fork of https://github.com/tylertreat/bench this library has the following changes:
- Publisher and subscribers are separated
- Publisher send async where possible and a timestamp is prepended to every message
- Subscribers read the timestamp inside the message and compare it to a current timestamp to derive latency
- Latencies are persisted to files - one per subscriber
- Added small tools to convert latency files into CSV and/or aggregrate the contents
- Added an additional implementation of a Kafka connector library
- Added NOOP requester to test performance of the tool itself
- Ability to specify request rate schedules via CSV files
- Ability to select content of sent messages. Default provides all zeros and random data. Extensible by user.
- Can determine and consider clock skew if publisher and subscriber runs on different machines
- Lots and lots of refactorings
